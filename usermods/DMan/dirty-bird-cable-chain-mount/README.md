Print on its side, no supports are needed

**Additional hardware**

3x M3 inserts and BHCS screws to hold the chain in place, and 2x M3x12 BHCS/SHCS to hold the mount to the X carriage.

Note: I'm using the Mini Sherpa mount. You might need to adjust the height by 4 mm if you are not using this little adapter!
